## :rocket: About

Welcome to my POC (proof of concept) to test **ARKit** with **React Native**!

This project was developed with the guys from [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat), following a great step by step from their Code Challenge.
You can check it out in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k12PTZHaHV4&t=1s).

The main goal was to render the ambar Pokemon in Augmented Reality :heart:
